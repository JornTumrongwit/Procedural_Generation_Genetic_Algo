# Procedural_Generation_Genetic_Algo
A project for my heuristics course. This is just to make a simple model of how a procedurally generated city might look through Python bar graphs.

There are a lot of files that aren't really used in the final project, but you can take a look at them if you wish.

Code that actually matters:
parameters.py: parameters for the procedural generation
tower_demo_d_tree.py: Using the parameters to create towers. Useful for generating towers and seeing how it looks without actually doing genetic algorithm
make_image_dtree.py: Make city from image
gencity_from_file.py: Make city from townfile.txt
